// This project is uses NJIT's unique GPA scale, which operates differntly than many other colleges and universities.
// In order to create this project, I used Java's Swing GUI and Java to create the actual GPA calculator.

// To use the application, you must input a Grade Value { A , B+ , B , C+ , C, F } and a number of credits.

// First, the program collects the user's scores and converts them into doubles from strings. Then, I created an array
// that takes in all the grades and credits, and use a for loop to iterate through it to determine how much each grade will
// impact the final GPA calculation. Then, I incorporate the past GPA and credits from semesters preceding this one, and
// calculate and print the final GPA.

// A few ways I will improve this project in the future include finding ways to indicate when the user has not inputted
// all proper data, and revision of the input is necessary. 

// I would also like to make this into a webapp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the future in the NJIT Student Homepage
// Project I am working on.
